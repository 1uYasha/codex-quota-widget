## Release Download

The latest stable release is `v1.0`:

[Download Codex Quota Widget v1.0](https://github.com/1uYasha/codex-quota-widget/releases/tag/v1.0)

Download the Windows portable `.exe` from the release page and run it directly. Windows may show an unknown-publisher warning because the app is not code-signed yet.

## Overview

Codex Quota Widget reads quota snapshots from your locally installed Codex application and presents them in a small floating desktop widget. It is designed for Windows users who want quick visibility into remaining Codex usage without keeping the full Codex app in focus.

The project is inspired by the desktop-widget idea in `xicunwus2025-sys/codex-led-widget`, but the repository identity, README content, visuals, Codex path handling, and privacy notes have been rewritten for this project.

## Features

- Shows remaining quota for the 5-hour Codex window.
- Shows remaining quota and reset time for the 7-day window.
- Displays the current plan type, such as `PLUS`.
- Reads today's token usage from local `.codex/sessions` logs.
- Supports always-on-top mode, tray hiding, startup launch, and configurable refresh intervals.
- Uses clear status colors: green for healthy, yellow for low, red for empty or failed, and blue for loading.

## Local Codex Path

The widget prefers the current local Codex installation:

```txt
%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin\<version-hash>\codex.exe
```

The widget uses the current local Codex installation to read quota data.

## Privacy and Security

- No Codex token input is required.
- Authentication tokens are not read, saved, printed, or uploaded.
- `.env`, `.codex`, logs, caches, build outputs, and local credential files are excluded from Git.
- Quota reads use your existing local Codex sign-in state.
- Today's token summary only reads usage fields from local session logs.
